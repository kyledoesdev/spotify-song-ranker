            Welcome to songrank.dev. This application will allow you to log in with your
            spotify account and rank your favorite artists' entire discography. This is not a bracket style ranking system.
            I've built a user-driven merge-sort algorithm to rank every possible combination of tracks as efficently as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">
            This application isn't limited to an artists' entire discography either, you can rank indivdual albums, a set
            of albums, just singles, etc. You can filter down your favorite artists' songs to just the ones you want to rank.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">
            After you've finished a ranking, feel free to share your finalized list with friends, download the list & more.
